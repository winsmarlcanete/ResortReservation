Description: 

  Task 1 - Develop a Transaction Based System using the C++ Programming Language.
  
  Task 2 - Identify the minimum requirements of the proposed transaction based system.
  
  Task 3 -  Include unique feature/s on their proposed project.

         
         
My main contribution:
        
-Documentation, Source Code, Flowchart. (All of members were highly inept despite all my efforts in guiding them, unfortunately.)
   

What I Learned:

-It is generally bad and hard to handle everything but I should enhance my directorship so that this incident will never occur again.
         
               
Note:

-Our school did not sponsor GitHub nor recommended to us. I just suggested this to our group since it can enhance our productivity.
   Also, I have no idea how to deploy this. But it can be viewed via https://htmlpreview.github.io/ (Just paste the html link of task2.html).
