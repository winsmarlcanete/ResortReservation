Note:

-Our school did not sponsor GitHub nor recommended to us. I just suggested this to our group since it can enhance our productivity.
         To execute this, copy the main.cpp source code and paste to an IDE since it this project only contins a single file. An alternative for this is running through command prompt by typing gcc main.ccp and typing main. Another option is to go to this link --> https://onlinegdb.com/xpE_op9BL (Run the code or Fork it if you want).
