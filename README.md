My main contribution:
        
-Documentation, Source Code, Flowchart. (All of members were highly inept despite all my efforts in guiding them, unfortunately.)
   

What I Learned:

-It is generally bad and hard to handle everything but I should enhance my directorship so that this incident will never occur again.
         
               
Note:

-Our school did not sponsor GitHub nor recommended to us. I just suggested this to our group since it can enhance our productivity.
         To execute this, copy the main.cpp source code and paste to an IDE since it this project only contins a single file. An alternative for this is running through command prompt by typing gcc main.ccp and typing main. Another option is to go to this link --> https://onlinegdb.com/xpE_op9BL (Run the code or Fork it if you want).
